# W2D
This is the W2D Repository for Phase one /DEV.
I'll begin fleshing this out as we continue moving along.

The West 2nd District (W2D) builds upon the technology momentum of the past 5 years to function more economically, thoughtfully, and proactively. We are deploying Over-The-Horizon capabilities to support Reno’s growth & revitalization with “interoperability” as a core focal point. That’s a fancy way of saying we are leveraging cutting-edge, “Lifestyle” technologies to help you, as a W2D resident or business, live and operate more efficiently and freely in a very customizable environment, tailored to fit your personal lifestyle and preferences. Freeing you up to focus on your businesses, families and those other important elements around you with minimal distractions. A better quality of life, or “Quality of Experience” is the desired end state of most technology-enabled products or solutions.  Here in the W2D, we recognize that residents and businesses need a healthy, sustainable environment to thrive in a safe, inviting, interactive community. We are building the Next Generation of a Smarter Reno.

When the Economic Development of Western Nevada (EDAWN) and our city council members engage business across the country and overseas to consider our City of Reno, we want to make ourselves as attractive to them as we can. We can achieve this through a variety of offerings and core recognition values, such as our Arts, Entertainment, outdoor activities, live events, and of course our attractive value to the entrepreneurs seeking exciting new business opportunities with low overhead. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies and deploying them in a seamless fashion throughout the W2D will give us a tactical edge over other cities where previously, we were unable to compete.

Several cities around the world have invested in "Intelligent Community" strategies in order to make their citizens safer. In one city in Kansas, they have seen huge benefits with a Public Works Management System where citizens use a mobile app or web portal to alert transportation officials about potholes, file police reports, or pay for traffic citations. When cities feel safer, businesses are more likely to open or stay in the community. Families are more likely to relocate to the area. The city spends less money on fighting crime and more money on preventing it, which is less expensive for everyone. Cities of all sizes benefit from the growth opportunities that develop when a community embraces the exciting possibilities that come with the Internet of Things. 

With Technology Innovation, comes inherent risk. You will find, that here in the W2D we take Security very seriously! In fact, it is at the very core of building a successful technology base to support all of this exciting innovation! The showcase technologies of the West 2nd Street District will be managed, operated, and defended by a state of the art Network Operations Centers (NOC) and Security Operations Center (SOC), operating in a cohesive deployment right here in the district, staffed with seasoned analysts, security engineers, and IT operations and networking professionals, focused on delivering secure, reliable, uninterrupted data services in a variety of formats to the district, 24/7/365.
